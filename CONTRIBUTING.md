Branches
--------
I have two main branches:

* The master branch always has a latest stable version
  of the code. All commits on this branch are Releases.

* The develop branch is the main branch for implementing and testing new features and fixing bugs.
  If you have a heavy feature you can create a separate branch for that. All PR is merged only to develop branch
